# gdal-segment

 * **GDAL Segment** implements various segmentation algorithms over raster images. It can
be used to segment large aerial, sattelite imagery of various formats supported by GDAL and
various layouts like multispectral or hyperspectral. It uses OpenCV for it's core algorithms,
and uses GDAL as I/O. Implementation here follows several multithread and memory optimizatons,
thus very large scenes are supported well.

```
    Usage: gdal-segment [-help] src_raster1 src_raster2 .. src_rasterN -out dst_vector
           -algo <SLICO (default), SLIC>] [-niter <1..500>]
           [-region <pixels>] [-ruler <1.00 ... 40.00>]

Default niter: 10 iterations
Default region: 10 pixels
Default ruler: 10.00
```
